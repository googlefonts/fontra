# Fontra

![Fontra Icon](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontra/blob/main/fontra-icon.svg?raw=true)

Fontra is an in-development browser-based font editor. It consists of two main parts:

- Fontra client — runs in the browser, written in JavaScript
- Fontra server — runs locally or on a remote machine, written in Python

## Installing Fontra

### Download and install _Fontra Pak_

[Fontra Pak](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontra-pak) is a Fontra distribution for macOS and Windows. It is a self-contained Fontra server application, which allows you to view and edit fonts in the default browser. We don't have releases for it yet, but you can grab the latest nightly build from the topmost [“Build Application”](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontra-pak/actions) workflow, or, more conveniently, directly from [fontra.xyz](https://fontra.xyz).

Fontra Pak also works on Linux and other platforms, but we do not provide binaries. For Linux, there are community-supported options.

### Install from the source code

#### Requirements

- Ensure you have **Python >= 3.10** installed, preferably from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

- Ensure you have **Node.js >= 20** installed, preferably from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

#### Setup

- Check out the Fontra repository (the one you are reading this from), cd into the root of the repository

- Create a Python venv in the root of the repo:

  `python3.10 -m venv venv --prompt=fontra`

  (Replace `python3.10` appropriately if you have a newer version installed.)

- Activate venv:

  `source venv/bin/activate`

- Install general dependencies:

  `pip install --upgrade pip`

  `pip install -r requirements.txt`

  `pip install -e .`

#### Testing

The following steps are needed if you want to run the automated tests and if you want to contribute:

- Install dependencies to run the automated tests:

  `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`

- Install `pre-commit` to run formatters and linters:

  `pre-commit install --install-hooks`

- To verify if everything is working correctly, run both test suites:

  `pytest`

  `npm test`

#### Running

- Start the fontra server with a path to a folder containing fonts (.designspace, .ufo, .ttf or .otf), using the `filesystem` subcommand:

  `fontra --launch filesystem /path/to/a/folder`

- The default browser will then navigate to:

  `http://localhost:8000/`

- To use Fontra with .rcjk data on disk, or to connect to a remote rcjk server, install the [`fontra-rcjk`](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontra-rcjk) plugin package. Then you can start it with a robocjk server hostname, using the `rcjk` subcommand provided by the `fontra-rcjk` plugin:

  `fontra --launch rcjk some-robocjk-server.some-domain.com`

- To use Fontra in development mode, add `--dev` to the command line:

  `fontra --dev --launch filesystem /path/to/a/folder`

With this option in place, a separate process will be spawned which watches for any changes made to the Javascript files, and automatically bundles these into the client directory on save. Additionally, in developer mode, Javascript errors report a more human-readable traceback.
